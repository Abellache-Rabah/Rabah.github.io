## About Me

I am a passionate Systems and Networks student currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Systems and Networks at the University of Évry Paris-Saclay. With a strong foundation in network architecture, system administration, and security, I am dedicated to designing and implementing robust, high-availability infrastructure solutions.

My technical expertise spans network protocols, Linux/BSD systems, virtualization technologies, and DevOps practices. I am particularly interested in redundant network architectures, secure backup solutions, and high-availability systems.

## Education

* **Master 1 in Computer Systems and Networks** (2024)  
  University of Évry Paris-Saclay  
  *Focus: System and Network Administration, Internet Protocols, Advanced Networks, Database Administration, Cryptography and Security*

* **Master 1 in Intelligent Systems** (2023-2024)  
  Ahmed Draya University of Adrar  
  *Focus: AI Problem Solving, Decision Support Systems, Neural Networks, Distributed Systems, Advanced Networks, Advanced Databases*

* **Bachelor's in Computer Systems** (2022-2023)  
  Ahmed Draya University of Adrar  
  *Focus: Software Engineering, Operating Systems, HCI, Computer Security, Algorithms, Data Structures, Programming/Development*

## Technical Skills

* **Networking:** TCP/IP, UDP, TLS, DNS, DHCP, VPN, VLAN, NAT, VRRP, CLAG, LACP, CARP/pfsync, iptables/nftables
* **Systems:** Linux (Debian/CentOS), Windows, BSD
* **DevOps:** Ansible, Git/Github, Docker, Podman
* **Virtualization:** VMWare, KVM
* **Databases:** MongoDB, MySQL, SQL Developer
* **Scripting:** Bash, Python
* **Tools:** Wireshark, iPerf3, nmap

## Notable Projects

### Redundant "Leaf-Spine" Network Architecture
Implemented a leaf-spine topology with high redundancy and availability:
* **Technologies:** CLAG (layer 2 redundancy), VRRP (layer 3 redundancy), VLANs (isolation), NFS, LACP (link aggregation)
* **Tools:** Cumulus Linux, Ansible (automation), Wireshark, VMware
* **Results:** Failover <1s, high availability, load balancing, flow isolation with maintenance of critical access

### Enterprise Centralized Backup Solution
Implemented an Enterprise Backup Infrastructure:
* **Technologies:** BorgBackup (encrypted/deduplicated backup), rsync (secure incremental transfer), ZFS (reliable storage with snapshots), SSH/SSHFS (end-to-end encryption), Cron (automation)
* **Tools:** Borg, WireGuard, OpenZFS, VMware
* **Results:** Anti-ransomware pull-based architecture, 85% space savings, RPO <1h

### High Availability VPN and Firewall Infrastructure
Implemented a Network Security Infrastructure:
* **Technologies:** OpenVPN, CARP/pfSync (automatic failover and synchronization), OpenBSD
* **Results:** 99.99% firewall availability, secure remote access

## Professional Experience

**Network/System Administration Internship** (September 2023 - July 2024)  
Ahmed Draya University of Adrar
* Participated in the configuration and installation of network infrastructure
* Installed operating systems (Linux and Windows)
* Assisted with hardware installation (routers, cabling, etc.) to support network deployment
